This is a math/biology research project I participated in during the summer of
2008. I wrote all of the code and did about half of the mathematical modeling
and design, and my more educated colleagues pored over biology journals, came
up with the ideas, and made sure the simulation was right :)

This project was funded by an NSF grant.

MIT license as usual.

The interesting stuff is in model.pdf, which explains how to build the project
and how to use it (though I doubt it provides enough context to be generally
useful...).
