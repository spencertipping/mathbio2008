This is a math/biology research project I participated in during the summer of
2008. I wrote all of the code and did about half of the mathematical modeling
and design, and my more educated colleagues found biology publications and made
sure the simulation was right :)

Because this research was funded by the NSF, it's now open source under the MIT
license.
